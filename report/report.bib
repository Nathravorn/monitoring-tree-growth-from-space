  ABSTRACT = {Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), as an active sensor transmitting long wavelengths, has the advantages of working day and night and without rain or cloud disturbance. It is further able to sense the geometric structure of forests more than passive optical sensors, making it a valuable tool for mapping forest Above Ground Biomass (AGB). This paper studies the ability of the single- and multi-temporal C-band Sentinel-1 and polarimetric L-band PALSAR-2 data to estimate live AGB based on ground truth data collected in New England, USA in 2017. Comparisons of results using the Simple Water Cloud Model (SWCM) on both VH and VV polarizations show that C-band reaches saturation much faster than the L-band due to its limited forest canopy penetration. The exhaustive search multiple linear regression model over the many polarimetric parameters from PALSAR-2 data shows that the combination of polarimetric parameters could slightly improve the AGB estimation, with an adjusted R2 as high as 0.43 and RMSE of around 70 Mg/ha when decomposed Pv component and Alpha angle are used. Additionally, the single- and multi-temporal C-band Sentinel-1 data are compared, which demonstrates that the multi-temporal Sentinel-1 significantly improves the AGB estimation, but still has a much lower adjusted R2 due to the limitations of the short wavelength. Finally, a site-level comparison between paired control and treatment sites shows that the L-band aligns better with the ground truth than the C-band, showing the high potential of the models to be applied to relative biomass change detection.},

  ABSTRACT = {Temperate forests are under climatic and economic pressures. Public bodies, NGOs and the wood industry are looking for accurate, current and affordable data driven solutions to intensify wood production while maintaining or improving long term sustainability of the production, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Free tools and open access data have already been exploited to produce accurate quantitative forest parameters maps suitable for policy and operational purposes. These efforts have relied on different data sources, tools, and methods that are tailored for specific forest types and climatic conditions. We hypothesized we could build on these efforts in order to produce a generic method suitable to perform as well or better in a larger range of settings. In this study we focus on building a generic approach to create forest parameters maps and confirm its performance on a test site: a maritime pine (Pinus pinaster) forest located in south west of France. We investigated and assessed options related with the integration of multiple data sources (SAR L- and C-band, optical indexes and spatial texture indexes from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and ALOS-PALSAR-2), feature extraction, feature selection and machine learning techniques. On our test case, we found that the combination of multiple open access data sources has synergistic benefits on the forest parameters estimates. The sensibility analysis shows that all the data participate to the improvements, that reach up to 13.7% when compared to single source estimates. Accuracy of the estimates is as follows: aboveground biomass (AGB) 28% relative RMSE, basal area (BA) 27%, diameter at breast height (DBH) 20%, age 17%, tree density 24%, and height 13%. Forward feature selection and SVR provided the best estimates. Future work will focus on validating this generic approach in different settings. It may prove beneficial to package the method, the tools, and the integration of open access data in order to make spatially accurate and regularly updated forest structure parameters maps effortlessly available to national bodies and forest organizations.},
